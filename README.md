## *ðŸ—‚ Data Structures Used*

### std::vector
Used for both:
- *Bullets*  
- *Enemies*

Benefits:
- Allows dynamic addition and removal of elements
- Helps manage fast-paced real-time updates
- No manual memory management required

### struct Coordinate
A simple structure to represent 2D positions (x, y) for bullets and enemies:
```cpp
struct Coordinate {
    int x, y;
};
